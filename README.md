# Flactory
When you're creating small applications using flask everything's great! but 
as you're trying to create more and more large applications with same 
structure you always want it will be kind of bothering to copy your last 
project, remove unwanted parts and change some parts and then start 
developing your application. It has too much trouble.

so I developed a little handy tool to have some project template structure 
and it will create your project base code just by a command.

# Installation
---

just: 
```
$ pip install flactory
```

# Getting started
---

when you installed flactory you can use 
```
$ flactory new
```
to start a project. It'll ask you some questions and your code is ready.
