What is Flactory? Why?
----------------------

When you're creating **small applications** using
`flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_ everything's **great**!
but as you're trying to create more and more **large applications**
with same structure you always want it will be kind of bothering
to copy your last project, remove unwanted parts and change some parts
and then start developing your application. It has too much trouble.

so **Flactory** was born to address the problem. It's a little handy tool to
create your project base codes using **template structures** that can be
defined by you or using others templates.
